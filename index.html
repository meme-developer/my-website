<h1>A short description</h1>
<p>Hydroelectricity is electricity made by generators that are pushed by the movement of water. It is usually made with dams that block a river to make a reservoir or collect water that is pumped there. When the water is released, the pressure behind the dam forces the water downpipes that lead to a turbine.<p>
